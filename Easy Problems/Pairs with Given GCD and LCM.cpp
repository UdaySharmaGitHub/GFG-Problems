/*
Pairs with Given GCD and LCM
Given two integers x and y representing the GCD and LCM of two unknown positive integers a and b, count the number of valid pairs (a, b) satisfying these conditions. Note that (a, b) and (b, a) are counted as distinct pairs when a ≠ b.

Examples:

Input: x = 2, y = 12
Output: 4
Explanation: The valid pairs are (2, 12), (4, 6), (6, 4), and (12, 2), since each pair has GCD = 2 and LCM = 12.
Input: x = 6, y = 4
Output: 0
Explanation: LCM must always be a multiple of GCD. Since y is not divisible by x, no valid pair exists.
Constraints:
1 ≤ x, y ≤ 104
