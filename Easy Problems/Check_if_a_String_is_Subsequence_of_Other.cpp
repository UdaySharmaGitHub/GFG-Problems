/*
Check if a String is Subsequence of Other
Given two strings s1 and s2. You have to check that s1 is a subsequence of s2 or not.
Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Examples:
Input: s1 = "AXY", s2 = "YADXCP"
Output: false
Explanation: s1 is not a subsequence of s2 as 'Y' appears before 'A'.
Input: s1 = "gksrek", s2 = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: true
Explanation: If we combine the bold character of "geeksforgeeks", it equals to s1. So s1 is a subsequence of s2. 
Constraints:
1 â‰¤ s1.size(), s2.size() â‰¤ 106

class Solution {
  public:
    bool isSubSeq(string& s1, string& s2) {
        // code here
          int n=s1.size();
        int m=s2.size();
        
        if(n>m) return false;
        int i=0, j=0;
        
        while(i<n && j<m){
            if(s1[i]==s2[j]){
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        
        if(i==n && j<=m) return true;
        return false;
    }
